**Contributor Notes:** Implementation, tests, case studies, and program management tools utilizing this crosswalk are not included in the NIST repository. For example, I built "Everyone's Guide to the CCPA" as a multipurpose tool which relies on this crosswalk. One use case is managing consumer complaints about businesses who violate the CCPA. Another use case is defending a business from unsubstantiated complaints, or building a privacy program that gathers evidence of compliance using NIST control standards. These implementation artifacts can and should be maintained independently by their creators or owners. If a user wants to help improve this crosswalk, issues, pull requests, comments, tests, etc. can be made in my personal staging repository hosted at <https://github.com/craigericksondpo/NIST-framework-resources>.
